2023 Mini All-Electric
Description: Since our very beginnings, we’ve created cars that deliver a maximum experience with a minimal footprint. The very first Mini, built in 1959, was as fun to drive as it was fuel-efficient, and quickly became the urban car of choice as a result. Today, this very same principle is being applied to our electric mobility offering. With battery-powered driving technology that adds even more energy to the MINI driving experience, the all-electric MINI Cooper SE 3-door and MINI Countryman Plug-in Electric Hybrid are designed to electrify every drive and every day. And with lower emissions (including zero emissions in the MINI Cooper SE 3 door), they’re leading the charge towards a brighter, more sustainable future.
Price:$45,590 CAD
Engine: Fully Electric Motor
Speed: 150km/h

2023 Mini 5-Door
Description: It’s everything you love about MINI…and more.

But with more doors, headroom, legroom, and cargo room, it may be the slightly better choice for anyone leading a slightly fuller life.
